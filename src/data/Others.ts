    'Fortunately, during High school where I studied Web Development and Web Design, I found out that it will during my studies become my passion.',
    'After a painful lot of part-time jobs, as a high schooler I had been searching for money wherever I could (from KFC to a warehouse) I finally after graduating from High school found my first IT-related job (if you could say that) as a tester of mobile applications in Å koda a.s.',
    'Only a month after working there I made my next (probably biggest) step towards my IT career. I was employed by a company called Aimtec a.s. as a Software Developer. The beginning was painful because my experiences were low, close to zero. But I went straight ahead and started learning, Java, SQL, Data analytics, Power BI, problem-solving, etc. Finally, I was growing as a developer.',
    'After finishing a year of studies at the University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Applied Sciences along with my new job I decided to explore the world and went for an Erasmus to Finland. Moving out of the country changed me the most. I decided to stay in Finland, so I applied to Centria University of Applied Sciences. And to my surprise, I was accepted.',
    'This chapter started a completely new life for me and changed me as a person as well as a student and developer. I started working as a Full-Stack Developer growing and deepening my knowledge every day in a new part-time remote job. Started working for the University and helping people there.'
